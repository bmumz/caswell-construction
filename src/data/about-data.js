  `We are the Caswell’s— a husband and wife home remodelling and small
    construction company. We've spent most of our lives working various
    jobs and trying to find something we really enjoyed, until we both
    realized our true calling was building things, changing spaces and
    making them beautiful.`,
  `We decided to open our business in June of 2020. Our goal is to
    create new and happy spaces, not only for our customers, but also
    for ourselves. So, as we help our wonderful customers, we also
    tackle projects in our own home. We document it all and show the
    good, the bad, and the ugly parts of the job, and of course the end
    results!`,
  ` We have a large family, so we understand how hard it is to transform
    a space on a budget. Whether it is indoor or outdoor, we have you
    covered. We offer a wide range of services, and we want to help you
    make your dream projects a reality, on a manageable and practical
    budget. Check us out on Facebook and Instagram to follow our
    journey.`,
